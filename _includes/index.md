<h2>Why this Challenge?</h2>
Switzerland lacks sufficient IT security professionals to protect its IT. 
With the Swiss Cyber Storm Cyber Security Challenge we help to mitigate this problem by offering a platform for finding cyber talents aged 14 to 30 years and by making the cyber security topic more popular among them.
Furthermore, we offer successful participants to become part of our <a href="/coe">Centre of Excellence</a> where they can participate in networking and continuing education events. 


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Contestants have to solve security related tasks from domains such as web security, mobile security, crypto puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics and more.
The challenge consists of three phases:<br>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Online qualification: May to July 2015 -</strong> Selection of the top 10 juniors and seniors using the online plattform hacking-lab.com.</li>
  <li><strong>Swiss national final: 11.-13. September 2015 -</strong> Selection of the top 5 juniors and seniors forming the Swiss team for the European Cyber Security Challenge final. </li>
  <li><strong>European Cyber Security Challenge final: 19.-22. October 2015 -</strong> Determining which country's team is the top team!</li>
</ol>
</p>
