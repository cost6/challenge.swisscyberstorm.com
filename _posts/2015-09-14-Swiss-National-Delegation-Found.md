title: "Swiss National Delegation Found: Discovering the Top Young Swiss Master Hackers"
---

Things got serious for the 17 best young cyber talents last weekend: they met at the Swiss
finals of the European Cyber Security Challenge 2015 in Sursee to compete against one another
in various disciplines related to IT security. The competition established a team of the
10 best young hackers in Switzerland. They will form the Swiss national delegation for the
European Cyber Security Challenge, competing against teams 
from five other European countries.

The young hackers had to battle a deadline to find security vulnerabilities in web applications, 
crack encrypted documents, or gain access to a protected system. They weren’t just being evaluated
on their technical skills: soft skills like their ability to work in a team or their presentation
style were also part of their overall ratings. "It’s not enough to simply find security problems.
Working out a solution as a team and being able to communicate with others is just as important
for a ‘good hacker," explained Ivan Bütler – jury member and owner of an IT security company.
 
That’s why the winning team isn’t just made up of the best technical masterminds; it also
includes members with excellent social skills. These ten young talents make up the Swiss delegation
for the European finals, which will take place at the KKL Luzern on October 21st. There, the young
team will need to prove its skills against teams from Germany, Austria, England, Spain, and Romania.
